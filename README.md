# Facebook Page Search
Searching Facebook Pages using Javascript.

Introduction :
I created this application to search thru Facebook Pages using the graph api and select few items from the result as favourite.

Folder Structure
- app
  - scripts
    - loader.js // this file will contain the funcationality of displaying loading icon when search is in progress.
    - main.js   // the application code to trigger graph api and search will reside here.
    - util.js   // utility code e.g. custom sort on Array.
